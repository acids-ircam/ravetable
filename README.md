# Ravetable synthesis - Latent signal processing

This repository introduces "Ravetable synthesis", the first synthesis paradigm based on "Latent Signal Processing" (LSP). This concept has been proposed by Philippe Esling and David Genova and is currently implemented as a Max4Live device. 

The development of a hardware version is currently undergoing at IRCAM through the PhD thesis of David Genova. 

If you are interested in using this concept for a music performance or installation or want to share / discuss / ask things about other research from ACIDS, you can do so in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/r9umPrGEWv) !

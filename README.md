# Ravetable synthesis - Latent signal processing

This repository introduces "Ravetable synthesis", the first synthesis paradigm based on "Latent Signal Processing" (LSP). This concept has been proposed by Philippe Esling and David Genova and is currently implemented as a Max4Live device. The development of a hardware version is currently undergoing at IRCAM through the PhD thesis of David Genova.
